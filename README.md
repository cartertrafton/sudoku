# Sudoku Solver 
>My attempt at learning p5.js

## Background
I do a lot of sudokus and I wanted to learn the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. It is a great visual programming tool that makes it incredibly easy to create visual applications.

## Solving Algorithm

```
if (puzzle = unsolved){
	solve();
}
```
